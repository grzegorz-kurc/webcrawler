# Web Crawler
A simple web crawler written as a .NET Core 6.0 console application that retrieves product information from a selected category of a well-known beauty shop and writes to an .xlsx file. The program uses the Html Agility Pack library, which is used to parse HTML documents, and NPOI - a library designed to read and write files from the Microsoft Office suite.
