# Web Crawler
A simple web crawler made as a .NET Core console application in version 6.0, downloading products from a selected category of a well-known cosmetics store. 
The program uses the Html Agility Pack library, used for parsing HTML documents, as well as NPOI - a library designed for reading and writing files from the Microsoft Office suite.
