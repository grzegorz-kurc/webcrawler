# Web Crawler
A simple web crawler, written as a .NET Core 6.0 console application, that downloads products from a selected category of a well-known cosmetics store. 
The program uses the Html Agility Pack library, which is used to parse HTML documents, and NPOI - a library designed to read and write files from the Microsoft Office suite.
